Problem 1: Algorithm Properties and Correctness

Scenario:
A weather forecasting system needs to calculate the average temperature for a city over the past n days. Two junior developers have proposed different algorithms.

--------------------------------------------------
Algorithm A:
1. total = 0
2. for i = 1 to n:
3.     total = total + temperature[i]
4. average = total / n
5. return average

Algorithm B:
1. sum = temperature[1]
2. for i = 2 to n:
3.     sum = sum + temperature[i]
4. for i = 1 to n:
5.     sum = sum / n
6. return sum

--------------------------------------------------
a) Evaluation Against the Five Fundamental Properties of an Algorithm

The five properties are: Input, Output, Definiteness, Finiteness, Effectiveness.

Algorithm A:
- Input: Accepts temperature array and n
- Output: Returns the average temperature
- Definiteness: Steps are clear and unambiguous
- Finiteness: Loop runs n times and terminates
- Effectiveness: Uses simple arithmetic operations

Conclusion: Algorithm A satisfies all five properties.

Algorithm B:
- Input: Accepts temperature array and n
- Output: Returns a value
- Definiteness: Steps are clearly defined
- Finiteness: Both loops terminate after finite steps
- Effectiveness: Uses basic arithmetic operations

Conclusion: Algorithm B also satisfies all five formal properties, even though it is logically incorrect.

--------------------------------------------------
b) Step-by-Step Execution

Input:
temperatures = [20, 25, 22, 24, 21]
n = 5

Algorithm A Execution:
Initial total = 0
After adding 20 → total = 20
After adding 25 → total = 45
After adding 22 → total = 67
After adding 24 → total = 91
After adding 21 → total = 112

Average = 112 / 5 = 22.4
Result: Correct output = 22.4

Algorithm B Execution:

First loop (sum calculation):
Initial sum = 20
After adding 25 → sum = 45
After adding 22 → sum = 67
After adding 24 → sum = 91
After adding 21 → sum = 112

Second loop (division):
After 1st division → 112 / 5 = 22.4
After 2nd division → 22.4 / 5 = 4.48
After 3rd division → 4.48 / 5 = 0.896
After 4th division → 0.896 / 5 = 0.1792
After 5th division → 0.1792 / 5 = 0.03584

Result: Incorrect output = 0.03584

--------------------------------------------------
c) Logical Error in Algorithm B

Algorithm B divides the sum by n inside a loop, causing the division to occur n times instead of once.

Instead of calculating:
average = (sum of temperatures) / n

It effectively calculates:
average = (sum of temperatures) / n^n

Violated Principle:
Division is not associative. Repeated division changes the mathematical meaning of the operation.

--------------------------------------------------
d) Comparison of Algorithms

Algorithm A:
- Simple and easy to understand
- Produces correct results
- Efficient with one loop
- Matches the mathematical definition of average

Algorithm B:
- Unnecessarily complex
- Produces incorrect results
- Uses an extra loop
- Misapplies the division operation

Conclusion:
Algorithm A should be chosen for production deployment because it is correct, efficient, simple, and maintainable.

--------------------------------------------------
e) Test Strategy for Algorithm A

Proposed Test Cases:

1. Normal case
   Input: [20, 25, 22, 24, 21], n = 5
   Expected Output: 22.4

2. Single day
   Input: [30], n = 1
   Expected Output: 30

3. Zero days (edge case)
   Input: [], n = 0
   Expected Output: Error or handled exception

4. Negative temperatures
   Input: [-5, 0, 5], n = 3
   Expected Output: 0

5. All identical values
   Input: [10, 10, 10, 10], n = 4
   Expected Output: 10

Additional validation:
- Ensure n > 0 before division
- Ensure n matches the number of temperature values
- Use floating-point division for accuracy
